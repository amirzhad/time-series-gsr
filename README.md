# time-series-gsr

This project is an implementation of Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting of Gas Sensor Array Readings.

The Forecasting part is implemented by the Vector Autoregression Model of statsmodels.

Download the original dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+exposed+to+turbulent+gas+mixtures

The Original Dataset contains many files. I've only implemented 1 file named '155_Et_H_Me_L.csv' from the downsampled folder.
